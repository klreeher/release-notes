## New Features

- Customized Platform Object ID Generation

A big question we get from clients a lot is "How can I make the OrderCloud API IDs work nicely with the IDs from my ERP or other internal systems?". 

Prior to API 1.0.66, you could either set the ID manually (which is a pain if you want incrementation to work well) or you could settle for the default platform random GUID, and keep track of your ERP integration ID in an `xp`, or some other work around.

We've added a new feature that aims to make this process much, much simpler!
